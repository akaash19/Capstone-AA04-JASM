## What is GroupConnect?

GroupConnect was created with a simple problem statement in mind:

How might families and groups of close friends maintain a safe, private collection of memories so that they can always remember shared moments and maintain a sense of identity?

With the rise of social media, we have created a web of connections among one another that is more complex than anything ever seen by humankind. We have grown in connectivity; however, we have lost a sense of privacy, of individuality, and of identity. GroupConnect aims to solve these issues by acting as an ‘Anti-Social Social Media’. GroupConnect is a private, invite-only social media platform where users can share their memories with their families and groups of close friends. GroupConnect aims to create a sense of identity for users online with dynamically created data visualizations to summarize connections in groups.



## What are the planned features for the future?

- Private Data Storage, with encryption, good policy

- Connectivity with family or friend groups

- Summarization and organization of shared data through:

  - Timeline
  - Map
  - Slideshow / Photo Albums
  - Family Tree

- Authentication

- Integration with existing services (apps, websites)

- User Role and Identity Management

- User created diagrams + organization

  

## What technologies does it use?

- Heroku for hosting (MVP Only, you can choose something else)

- MySQL (ClearDB through Heroku, though you could port to a different database easily)

- Express

- React

- node.js

  

## What do I need to do to get started on development?

- After cloning the repository, make sure to `npm install` in the root directory of the project, as well as in the client folder
- To push local changes: Make a commit, then `git push origin master`
  or create a branch: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`, make a commit, then `git push origin <branch_name>`
- Pushing changes to Heroku website (if you are also using Heroku for hosting)
  `git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/<your Heroku .git URL>`, make a commit, then`git push heroku master`
- To run the app locally on http://localhost:3001/ (server and client) use `npm run dev` then `CTRL+C` to close it
- We used our own MySQL database for the project, but it is hardly used yet, so just add your own database URL/info to `server.js` to use your own
- Let us know if you need any help!
