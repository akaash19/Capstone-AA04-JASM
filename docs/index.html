						<h2  style=color:red;> NOTICE: GroupConnect is being transitioned to Open Source!</h2>
						<p>After long consideration, our team has decided to open source 
							GroupConnect as our project comes to the end of its current development
							cycle. If you want to add to or fork from GroupConnect, the project
							repository is available at: <a href=https://github.com/akaash19/Capstone-AA04-JASM> Github</a>
						</p>
						<h2>What is GroupConnect?</h2>
						<p>With the rise of social media, we have created a web of connections among one another that is more complex than 
							anything ever seen by humankind. We have grown in connectivity; however, we have lost a sense of privacy, of 
							individuality, and of identity. GroupConnect aims to solve these issues by acting as an ‘Anti-Social Social Media’. 
							GroupConnect is a private, invite-only social media platform where users can share their memories with their families 
							and groups of close friends. GroupConnect aims to create a sense of identity for users online with dynamically created 
							data visualizations to summarize connections in groups.
						</p>
						<p> Whether you are looking to create a group for your family,
							friends, or loved ones, GroupConnect is perfect for you. GroupConnect allows users to create customizable groups
							where they can invite others to join. On these group pages, members of the groups are able to post a wide
							range of different media including text, audio, images, or video. We aim to create a safe place for groups 
							and families to save protect these precious artifact so that not a single memory will be lost.
						</p>
						<p>
							GroupConnect prides itself on its high-grade security and privacy features. We understand that these memories and experiences
							mean a lot to you so we treat it the same way by encrypting all data posted within groups. We want our users to feel like 
							their data and their privacy is protected; and we aim to acheive that everyday. 
						</p>
						<p>
							If you want a safe place to post your valuable memories so that they can be passed on and never lost, use the most
							trusted and most safe choice, use GroupConnect and relive your experiences.
